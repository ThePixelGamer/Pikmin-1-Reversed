# Distant Forest

## Contents

* **What is this?**
	- A faithful recreation of the Pikmin 1 debug programs source code.
		- Using the same tools and compiler available back in 2001 when the program was being developed.
		- And has the compiled ASM compared side-by-side for accuracy and veracity.
		

* **Overview** 
	- This project provides compileable, readable code that has been reverse engineered from the debug .exe and accompanying .dll(s).
	- It was created with improvement in mind, and as we get closer to completely RE'ing the executable files we will improve the program so that we may be able to uncover some hidden secrets embedded within.
